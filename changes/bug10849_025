  o Removed code:
    - The TunnelDirConns and PreferTunnelledDirConns options no longer
      exist; tunneled directory connections have been available since
      0.1.2.5-alpha, and turning them off is not a good idea. This is a
      brute-force fix for 10849, where "TunnelDirConns 0" would break
      hidden services.
