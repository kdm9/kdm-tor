  o Major bugfixes (relay):
    - When uploading to the directory authorities, use a direct dirport
      connection if we are a uploading an ordinary, non-anonymous directory
      object. Previously, relays would used tunnel connections under a
      fairly wide variety of circumstances. Fixes bug 11469; bugfix on
      0.2.4.3-alpha.
