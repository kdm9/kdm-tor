  o Minor bugfixes (Directory server):
    - When sending a compressed set of descriptors or microdescriptors,
      make sure to finalize the zlib stream. Previously, we would write
      all the compressed data, but if the last descriptor we wanted to
      send was missing or too old, we would not mark the stream as
      finished. This caused problems for decompression tools. Fixes bug
      11648; bugfix on 0.1.1.23.
