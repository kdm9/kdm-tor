  o Package cleanup:
    - The contrib directory has been sorted and tidy. Before, it was an
      unsorted dumping ground for useful and not-so-useful things. Now,
      it has been divided based on functionality, and the items which
      seemed to be nonfunctional or useless have been removed. Resolves
      ticket 8966; based on patches from "rl1987".
